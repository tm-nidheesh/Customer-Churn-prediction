# Customer-churn-prediction

Analyzing customer data from a telecommunications company to determine why customers are leaving and what can be done to retain them.
By using statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms we can identify key factors that contribute to churn.
This predictive model uses Random Forest Classifier along with upsampling technique(because the dataset is imbalanced) and deployed using Flask.
